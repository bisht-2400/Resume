                   Information technology (IT) refers to the combination
                    of hardware, software, and services that people use to
                    manage, communicate, and share information.Systems analysis and design is a step-bystep
                    process for developing high-quality
                    information systems. An information
                    system
                    combines technology, people, and
                    data to provide support for business functions such as order processing, inventory
                    control, human resources, accounting, and many more. Some information systems
                    handle routine day-to-day tasks, while others can help managers make better decisions,
                    spot marketplace trends, and reveal patterns that might be hidden in
                    stored data.</div>
